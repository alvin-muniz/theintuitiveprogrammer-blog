[{"content":"The math is there, with sustained effort, results become apparent. I\u0026rsquo;m using this blog to serve as a measure of my knowledge in java development. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that at some point this might help others on their journey. Today, during a pairing session, I had forgotten how to kill the process that is on a certain port. It was kind of agitating but it served as a reminder that we should invite such an experience to be something of good use, something that will serve to increase your understanding of a specific domain of choice given that you are deliberate about it. Killing the process on port :8080\nlsof -i :8080 this will print out the PID which you will then proceed to kill\nkill -9 PID This might feel awkward if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done this stuff before, but worry not, developing an understanding of what the port is and why you need to kill it is important and an early lesson that benefits even experienced developers to revisit. This is a quick and simple one for today and remember, as long as you do 1% of concentrated effort, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the results in the long run.\nCheers,\nA\n","date":"28 February, 2022","id":0,"permalink":"/posts/003-one-percent-more-over-time/","summary":"Giving 1% more concentrated effort over a period of time","tags":"","title":"1% more over time"},{"content":"As a new software developer, it is your responsibility to understand the product that you are developing for and ask questions in instances where you do not know the answer. Having spent the better part of my career in marketing and graphic design, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed an astute ability to listen and ask good questions. While developing a technological understanding of the tools is important and necessary, I found that augmenting the technical learning with practical business domain understanding was critical in allowing me to develop a fluency in the product that I was working with. Between each and every goal, between each and every gap in knowledge were small incremental steps towards understanding. Mindfully we take these steps and enjoy the process of stepping forward with our foot grounded in our very best understanding of the problem. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s bad engineering, and most people reason with problems differently. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say exactly what route is the best route and that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just important to find what works with you and to reinforce it. The debugger works for me but admittedly even I\u0026rsquo;m questioning that tactic, and recognizing that my style will evolve over time and that\u0026rsquo;s a process you\u0026rsquo;ve got to fall in love with.\nCheers,\nAlvin\nCode Block if(10 == 10) { console.log(\u0026#39;YES\u0026#39;) } ","date":"20 February, 2022","id":1,"permalink":"/posts/002-debug-early-debug-often/","summary":"7 months in and i\u0026rsquo;ve used the debugger over 10,000 times","tags":"","title":"Debug early and debug often"},{"content":"Software engineering has boomed. If you\u0026rsquo;re between the ages of 24 and 45, then likely you are or know someone who is a software engineering. Let\u0026rsquo;s remember exactly what software engineering is. The development of an idea into an actuality. Our generation has seen such a scale of rapid development in the application development world that anyone with an idea and knowledge of programming can potentially disrupt longstanding industries. This is the age of the idea. The demand for software engineers is huge. Training schools, known as boot camps, aim to upskill even the most novice of software engineers. This drastically reduced the barrier to entry for this field. A more diverse talent pool of applicants presented itself in a time when inequality gaps stemmed from systems that inadvertently oppressed women and people of color. I am one of the thousand of people who decided to pursue software engineering as a career path with little prior training as a Fine Arts major who went into marketing and communications. I\u0026rsquo;ll share honestly and transparently. Perhaps as a way to provide historical record of this time and place that we find ourselves in. This blog will certainly evolve over time, and I hope to evolve with it. I hope you do too somehow. :-)\nThank you for being here in this space.\nCheers,\nA\n","date":"1 February, 2022","id":2,"permalink":"/posts/001-software-dev-experience/","summary":"This is a first post on a hugo blog.","tags":"","title":"The felt experience of software development"}]
