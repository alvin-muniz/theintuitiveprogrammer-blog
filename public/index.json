I\u0026rsquo;m\nusing this blog to serve as a measure of my knowledge in java development.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hoping that at some point this might help others on their journey. Today,\nduring a pairing session, I had forgotten how to kill the process that is on\na certain port. It was kind of agitating but it served as a reminder that we\nshould invite such an experience to be something of good use, something that\nwill serve to increase your understanding of a specific domain of choice\ngiven that you are deliberate about it.

This is a quick and simple one for today and remember, as long as you do 1% of concentrated effort, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the results in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Having spent the better part of my career in\nmarketing and graphic design, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed an astute ability to listen and\nask good questions. While developing a technological understanding of the\ntools is important and necessary, I found that augmenting the technical\nlearning with practical business domain understanding was critical in\nallowing me to develop a fluency in the product that I was working with.\nBetween each and every goal, between each and every gap in knowledge were\nsmall incremental steps towards understanding. Mindfully we take these steps and\nenjoy the process of stepping forward with our foot grounded in our very best\nunderstanding of the problem. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s bad engineering, and most people\nreason with problems differently. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say exactly\nwhat route is the best route and that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just important to find\nwhat works with you and to reinforce it. The debugger works for me but\nadmittedly even I\u0026rsquo;m questioning that tactic, and recognizing that my style will\nevolve over time and that\u0026rsquo;s a process you\u0026rsquo;ve got to fall in love with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"code-block\"\u003eCode Block\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-typescript\" data-lang=\"typescript\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003eif\u003c/span\u003e(\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e==\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e) {\n    \u003cspan style=\"color:#a6e22e\"\u003econsole\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cspan style=\"color:#a6e22e\"\u003elog\u003c/span\u003e(\u003cspan style=\"color:#e6db74\"\u003e\u0026#39;YES\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e)\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

If you\u0026rsquo;re between the ages of 24 and 45,\nthen likely you are or know someone who is a software engineering.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s remember exactly what software engineering is. The development of an idea into an actuality.\nOur generation has seen such a scale of rapid development in the application development world that\nanyone with an idea and knowledge of programming can potentially disrupt longstanding industries.\nThis is the age of the idea. The demand for software engineers is huge.\nTraining schools, known as boot camps, aim to upskill even the most novice of software engineers.\nThis drastically reduced the barrier to entry for this field. A more diverse talent pool of\napplicants presented itself in a time when inequality gaps stemmed from systems\nthat inadvertently oppressed women and people of color. I am one of the thousand\nof people who decided to pursue software engineering as a career path with little prior training\nas a Fine Arts major who went into marketing and communications. I\u0026rsquo;ll share honestly and transparently.\nPerhaps as a way to provide historical record of this time and place that we find ourselves in.\nThis blog will certainly evolve over time, and I hope to evolve with it.\nI hope you do too somehow. :-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for being here in this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA\u003c/p\u003e\n"
